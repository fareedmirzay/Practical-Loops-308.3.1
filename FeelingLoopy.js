// Your task is to write a script that accomplishes the following:
// Loop through the characters of a given CSV string.
// Store each “cell” of data in a variable.
// When you encounter a comma, move to the next cell.
// When you encounter the “\r\n” sequence, move to the next “row.”
// Log each row of data.
// You do not need to format the data, the following works well.
// console.log(cell1, cell2, cell3, cell4);
